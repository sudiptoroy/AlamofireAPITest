# AlamofireAPITest
This is a test project for testing Alamofire Framework for API. To install Alamofire for this project I've used Carthage.
I've used DarkSky's Public weather API for the task.
The project shows the following points in the project for a given location:
* Show Current time
* Show Summary from Currently weather
* Show Average of precipProbability
